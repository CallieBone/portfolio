    <h3>Essay 4: "There Has been an Increase in Permissiveness since the 1960s"</h3>
    <p>
      My essay title: “Does Leniency and Respect Mix in Modern America?”, explores how permissiveness—defined as a relaxation of strict social rules—has evolved in U.S. society from the 1920s to the present. It traces cultural shifts through historical documents, advertisements, youth behavior, the Baby Boom, women’s rights activism, and LGBTQ+ struggles. The paper argues that America has steadily grown more lenient, loosening traditional norms around gender roles, beauty standards, and sexuality. However, it concludes with a nuanced reflection: while permissiveness has expanded freedom and equality, it does not always guarantee respect, leaving open the question of whether some rules should remain stricter for the good of society.

 “It’s An Actual Pregnancy ‘Test’?!” visually explains the step-by-step process of taking the Proper Pregnancy Plan (PPP) survey. It begins with scheduling an appointment between 6AM and 10PM, followed by arriving at the facility and being guided by doctors to a calming pink room.</p>

 In this presentation, that I made up for a fake company, I introduce myself as Dr. Callie Jones, a government official with a PhD in ChildCare, Pregnancy Research, and IQ Statistics. I explain the product I’ve developed, the Proper Pregnancy Plan (PPP), a 200-question survey designed to prevent unplanned pregnancies and ensure that parents are prepared for the responsibilities of raising children. I share fantasy statistics showing that 87.49% of parents are unfit based on economic and mental status, and present this survey as an ethical solution to reduce that number and protect future generations.</p>

 In this project, Service learning project, or the (SSOL/“The Smooth Sailing Organizational Life”), I worked with UALR Associate Director, Keith Harris, to create robotic kits for local schools to enhance STEM education and provide hands-on learning experiences. I also used Google Spreadsheets to calculate how much each kit had for each school.</p>

<h3> All of these projects have taught me valuable lessons, which include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Communication Competence:</strong> Practicing clear, inclusive, and responsive dialogue with students and audiences.</li>
  <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Understanding diverse personalities and making others feel heard, respected, and supported.</li>
  <li><strong>Active Listening:</strong> Using verbal and nonverbal cues to show attentiveness and build trust.</li>
  <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Navigating unexpected behaviors and adjusting tone or strategy to meet different needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Guiding others through structured tasks while maintaining a respectful and equal dynamic.</li>
  <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Managing disruptive moments with restraint and emotional awareness.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Speaking:</strong> Presenting ideas confidently and persuasively in both formal and creative settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-Awareness:</strong> Reflecting on communication habits and striving to improve tone, credibility, and impact.</li>
  <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Creating environments where every voice matters and no question is dismissed.</li>
  <li><strong>Creative Problem-Solving:</strong> Designing systems and presentations that address real-world challenges with imagination and structure.</li>
